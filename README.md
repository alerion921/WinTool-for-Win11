Since this started out as a fork from ChrisTitusTech i give credit but it has been heavily modified since.. so it does not qualify as a fork no more since i have added countless improvements...

Paste this command into Powershell (admin):
```
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alerion921/WinTool-for-10-11/main/WinTool.ps1'))
```
Or, shorter:
```
iwr -useb  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alerion921/WinTool-for-10-11/main/WinTool.ps1 | iex
```
